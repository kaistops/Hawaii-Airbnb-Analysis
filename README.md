# Hawaii-Airbnb-Analysis

Airbnb has become a staple in today's sharing economy, allowing for homeowners to rent out their properties to vacation-goers from all around the world. The website [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/) was founded by Murray Cox to make data on Airbnb easily accessible so communities could be empowered to understand the effect of residential renting on their communities. Data on "Inside Airbnb" is updated every quarter and includes information on listings, availability, reviews, ratings, and hosts in the community. 

For this project, I have decided to analyze Airbnb data for the Hawaiian Islands using a combination of Python and PostgreSQL, the latter of which is made available in the Jupyter Notebook environment through the toolkit SQLAlchemy. While Hawaii is a beautiful vacation destination and its economy is dependent on the tourism industry, there have been concerns raised over native Hawaiians getting priced out of the islands due to the influx of people wanting to purchase and rent out homes on the islands. The goal of this project is to analyze the available Airbnb data for the State of Hawaii to understand general trends in the data and unpack how the prevalence of listings, positive and negative reviews, and the hosting population may impact the Hawaiian community. 

This project showcases the following data processing methods: Data Cleaning and Validation, Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, PostgreSQL,  Natural Language Processing (NLTK), Sentiment Analysis, Statistical Testing (scipy.stats)
